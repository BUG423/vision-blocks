# SOTA - State-of-the-Art Neural Network Modules

[![English](https://img.shields.io/badge/README-English-blue)](README_EN.md)
[![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/README-中文-red)](README.md)

A systematically organized open-source repository of commonly used neural network modules, with a focus on computer vision tasks.

> **Note**: This repository also has a `bcl` branch that provides modules adapted for time-series BCL format data. Switch branches to get processing code for different input formats:
> ```bash
> git checkout bcl  # Switch to BCL time-series format branch
> ```

## Overview

This project collects and implements popular plug-and-play neural network modules for computer vision, covering image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and more. Each module includes clear documentation on its paper background, architectural design, PyTorch implementation, and test code. **All modules are originally designed.**

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- thop (optional, for FLOPs statistics)
